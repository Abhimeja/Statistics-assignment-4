    "A z-score of 1 means that the data point (75) is one standard deviation above the population mean (70). In other words, the value of 75 is higher than the average value in the population by one standard deviation. The positive sign indicates that it is above the mean, and the magnitude of 1 indicates the number of standard deviations away from the mean. Z-scores are helpful in standardizing data, making it easier to compare different data points from different populations or datasets. A positive z-score indicates that the data point is above the mean, while a negative z-score would indicate it is below the mean."
